## Overview

This project is Advanced Lane Finding on the Road in Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree

## Goals/Steps

My project consisted of 9 steps:

1. camera calibration using chessboard images,
2. undistort image,
3. create a thresholded binary image,
4. Use a perspective transform to wrap image,
5. Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.,
6. Find the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center,
7. Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image,
8. Display numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position,
9. Run pipeline in a video.
